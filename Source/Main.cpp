NOTES:
    - so far created a map system that can hold two types of data bool and char file type in

    - next steps to create a system for viewing the map

/*
Miles Stones:
    - Map system created, able to view a single cell and chunk with global coors.
    - next to make way for node to interact with map, partly done with with cell type and active note.
